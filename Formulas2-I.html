        <p>
            The determination of the unit cost is the most important purpose of cost 

            </p>
        <p>
           accounting defines it as the value of a particular item.
            </p>
            <p>
           The unit cost of projected production consists of the cost of direct material, direct labor and manufacturing costs.
             </p>
            <p>
           proyected cost of:
             </p>
            <p>
         1.- indirect material 
                <br>
                2.- direct labor
                <br>
                3.- manufacturing expenses
             </p>
        <p>
            The unit cost serves as an input for other calculations such as the profit per unit, the comparison with the sale price, equilibrium point or simply to be compared with the budgeted cost and be considered for control purposes.
            </p>
        <p>
        derives from the estimation of fixed costs and variable costs for a business. Because the unit cost includes both the administrative and general expenses of a fixed nature as well as the direct costs of materials and labor mostly variable or correlated to the level of production and sale.
            </p>
        <p>
           The unit cost is a measure of the total costs and expenses necessary to produce, safeguard, transport and sell a unit of a particular product or service.
            </p>
        <p>
            The unit cost is not necessarily the retail cost of an item, it is much more comparable with an average cost. The sale price that equals the unit cost represents a point of equilibrium for a particular item or service. So that translates into the minimum price at which an item can be sold to avoid generating losses.
