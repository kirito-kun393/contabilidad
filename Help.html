    <h2>How works: </h2>
   There are small parts of this calculator that you do not understand, such as:

Your redirects, which have the functionality of the page breaks,


Our calculator has other functions apart from the basic ones that would be addition, subtraction, multiplication and division,
even so we also have other operations such as: square root, p, and powers, even though these are outside the system, for example, why, by itself, why, by, by, by, by, why, why not, by what not more advanced.

In the update we will extract different functions, apart we will have the functions that are in the development, we will have lists in the next update, we will have more functions, such as having a scientific calculator in hand
