           </p>
           <p>
           To determine the cost of production it is necessary to elaborate a statement of costs, 
in which expenditures are considered as the raw material and direct labor, factors that together are known as prime cost, which is one of the parts of the cost statement

           To determine the cost of production, it is necessary to elaborate a statement of costs, in which expenses such as raw material and direct labor are considered, factors that together are known as prime cost, which is one of the parts of the cost statement. 
            </p>
           <p>
The structure of the first cost will then be:
Raw material: xxx

                <h2 style="color:gray" class="fondo">cost indirect:</h2>
           <p>
            The indirect cost is one of the types of costs that affects the production process of one or several products that the company subsequently sells.
            </p>
           <p>
             What really characterizes these costs is that they can not be assigned directly to each of the to each product individually, which will guide you later when defining the final sale price.products.
 If you produce cars, you know that in each car, you will need as raw material, 4 wheels, for example. However, this is not possible to do with the indirect costs. It will be done only after having defined a coherent allocation criterion, which allows you to calculate your allocation 

            </p>
           <p>
Something that must be very clear is that there are many indirect costs that a company can have and that the imputation criteria will be different depending on the type of indirect cost and, depending on the product to which we are referring.

             <h2 style="color:gray" class="fondo">Cost production:</h2>
           <p>
           The cost is the economic expense that is carried out to buy or maintain a service or a product. 
The concept of production, on the other hand, refers to the action of producing (elaborating, manufacturing, originating).
It is the set of expenses that are necessary to produce a service or a good.


            </p>
           <p>
          Production costs can be fixed costs (which remain stable in the face of changes in the production level) or variable costs (they change as the volume of production is altered).  
            </p>
           <p>
            we have to establish that within the costs of production there are two other types clearly differentiated.

We are referring to the following:

- Direct costs, which are those that are linked and related to each item that occurs. Example of these would be the money that costs to buy the raw material with which it is created.

- Indirect costs, which are those that do not directly affect that article. Examples of this type of production costs are the salaries of the workers in the administrative area of the company and the cost of renting the premises where it is located.



            </p>
           <br>
            <h2 style="color:gray" class="fondo">Cost distribution:</h2>
           <p>they are all the disbursements incurred by a producer to get their products, from their manufacturing plant to the place where they are acquired, thus constituting a fundamental component of the total cost to the producer and the price paid by consumers, therefore his analysis is very important in terms of business efficiency.


                       </p>
           <p>
         There are four factors to consider in order to apply the distribution costs:
            </p>
           <p>
           1.	The creation of demand: how consumers' interest in the product is aroused, includes, among other activities, advertising and sales promotion.</p>
       <p>
          2.	Obtention of the order: includes the expenses inherent to the sales force.
           </p>
           <p>
            3.	Product handling and delivery: includes transportation, storage and other logistics activities.
            </p>
           <p>
           4.	Control of the sale: includes the investigation and opening of the credit, accounting routine for its registration, preparation of sales analysis, collection service and all other inherent functions until the sale is translated into money.
            </p>
           <p>
        This method has its origin in accounting by areas of responsibility, which avoids certain dangers of arbitrarily spilling the distribution costs between market segments, which can create some confusion, which can be avoided if the cost system is established of distribution, certain control factors are used, that is, the cost determined by geographical area.
 When analyzing the costs of distribution by order amounts, those costs that vary in proportion to the number of orders processed, provide a logical basis for application to obtain the profits generated by each order.

           <br>
            <h2 style="color:gray" class="fondo">total cost of operation:</h2>
           <p>
          Total operating costs and balance volume are two parameters that help keep track of your business' liabilities and the amount of sales you need.

Calculate the cost of your rental contract, fixed salaries, utility bills, telephone bills, Internet accounts, insurance, banking services and other fixed costs. These are the items you must pay, regardless of your sales. 

All expenses must cover the same period of time, for example a fiscal year or calendar, a period of three months, a month or a week.

            </p>
           <p>
         Determine the expenses that vary depending on the amount of products you produce or purchase. These expenses include, but are not limited to, the cost of raw materials and the wages of the workers who manufacture and distribute your products.     
            </p>
           <p>
       they are the expenses that the institution will face during the period after the initial investment; that is, after the completion of the project. For evaluation purposes, the relevant operating costs are the incremental operating costs, those that result from the difference between the operating costs in the situation with the project minus the operating costs foreseen in the baseline scenario or situation without project.
            </p>
           <p>
      Operating costs or operating costs of the project are those that occur after the start, construction or installation of the new productive capacity until the end of its useful life.
The investment costs of a project are, by definition, the resources that are assigned to fixed investment and working capital, both at the beginning of the project and, occasionally, throughout its useful life. Operating costs, on the other hand, represent the flow of essential expenses to obtain the benefits.
